    <!-- In the above style tag, you can define various css properties & its called Internal CSS but Inline CSS will get prefernce over Internal
        CSS. And the Style tag is defined in the Head tag of the HTML program.-->
        <!-- If you want to add your external CSS file in the HTML Program, then you can do that using link tag in the head tag. -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="types_of_css.css">
        <!-- In case of CSS, whichever thing you add in as CSS then the preference is given to the latest CSS properties which you added.
        For example, In above line if you place the link tag before style tag then style tag will take the preference in the web page. 
        BUT IF YOU WANT THAT YOUR DEFINED CSS WILL TAKE PREFERENCE THAN OTHERS THEN YOU CAN ADD THE ATTRIBUTE "!important(with exclamation mark)"
        AFTER THE DEFINED PROPERTY like: color: blueviolet !important;-->
